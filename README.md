Setting Up Local Development Environment for e-Commerce Project

To begin development on the e-commerce project utilizing PHP and the Apache server, it is imperative to establish a local development environment by adhering to the following comprehensive steps:

Step 1: Clone the PHP Backend Repository

Launch a terminal or command prompt on your local workstation.

Navigate to the destination directory where you intend to house the cloned repository.

Execute the subsequent command to clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Abhaygajeepara/eCommercePHP.git
This command shall effectively replicate the PHP backend codebase within a newly designated "eCommercePHP" directory.

Step 2: Initiate myphpAdmin and Apache Server

It is paramount to ensure the presence of a suitable local development environment, such as XAMPP or WAMP, equipped with both Apache server and MySQL for myphpAdmin functionality.
Access the local server control panel, for instance, the XAMPP Control Panel.
Ascertain the commencement of services pertaining to both Apache server and MySQL by utilizing the control panel.
Following the successful initiation of these services, access to phpMyAdmin shall be attainable through a web browser by navigating to the designated URL: http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
